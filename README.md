***Incremental backup tool for MongoDB***
## Overview

 Tayra can be viewed as an external and persistent oplog that is stored on the 
 file system instead of residing within MongoDB. The files generated can then be
 used to restore the data incrementally to any target MongoDB instance, which can
 be injected into a replica set in case of any event that threatens the
 availability of service.<br>

* Features Summary

 * Selective Backup
 * Rotating Logs in backup and restore
 * Surviving node crash in a replica set
 * Secured and unsecured backup/restore
 * Analyse documents to restore using Dry Run
